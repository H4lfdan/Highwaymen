# Highwaymen

**OVERVIEW**

Highwaymen is a classic tower defense game. Merchant caravans will take the shortest path across the wooded landscape from one castle to the other. Place ballistae to attack the caravans and shape the path they must take to their destination. Each caravan destroyed rewards you gold to spend on even more ballistae.
In the current level, there will only ever by up to three active wagons at any moment, and their health will increase each time they respawn. You can build ballistae in any unoccupied space, but not if it would completely wall off the caravan's path, so be careful!
